Creating Azure Static Web app with HTML and CSS

Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to the Azure Cloud - directly from the code repository. With SWA, static assets are separated from traditional web servers, and served from geographically distributed content servers worldwide for speed and efficiency. API endpoints are hosted using a serverless architecture that is cost-efficient and scalable on-demand.
